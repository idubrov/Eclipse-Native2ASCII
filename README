This project is a simple workaround for the bug 65571 of Eclipse properties file editor.

To build the extension, execute "mvn package" (Apache Maven2 is required, http://maven.apache.org)

To use this extension, simply put the binary JAR into the <JDK_HOME>/jre/lib/ext directory,
run the Eclipse, open the Window->Preferences dialog, navigate to General->Content Types,
select "Java Properties File" node under "Text" node on the right, and change the default
encoding to "ISO-8859-1-ESCAPED". After that, the properties files with unicode escapes
will be displayed in "native" form in the properties file editor and converted to the
escaped form automatically upon save.
